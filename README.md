# CS558 Homomorphic Encryption for financial computations

## OM AMIT GANDHI (A20560944) (ogandhi1@hawk.iit.edu)

### Implementation
#### Finance-web app:
1. As you can see there are two folders, one is with the backend of the project and one with the frontend.
2. For the backend you will need to have python environment setup in the machine. You can use the venv environment for that using the following command, `python3 -m venv venv_name`.
3. After that just install all the necessary libraries using the following commands.
    `pip install tenseal`
    `pip install Flask`
    `pip install Flask-Cors`
4. Now just activate the environment and run the code.
5. After that run the code for the frontend by firstly installing using `npm install` and then run using 'npm run dev`. 
6. Open the your desirable browser and go to the `http://localhost:5173/`.

#### Machine Learning Model:
1. For this I have provided the python notebook and the python file both.
2. For the notebook one just go to google colab or the kaggle notebook strictly, do not use your local machine and execute all the cells.
3. For the python file install the concrete-ml library with the other standard libraries first and then run the program.
